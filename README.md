## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility class CSS Framework
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/) - promise-based http client library for javascript

### What I learned

In building this application, I learned a lot about styling web pages, especially in using css properties, namely translate and transform origin

### Continued development

For future development, I want to add a login feature and a feature to save the shortened URL for each user account. In addition, the addition of some pages is also needed to make this application more alive

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12150377/css3-transform-scale-stick-to-bottom) - This forum helped me in understanding how to make image scaling possible from the bottom as opposed to scale from the center of the image
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Obviously the most important thing in applying the styling of the framework on the website is to read directly on the documentation
